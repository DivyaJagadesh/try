GIT MILESTONE WORKFLOW (BEGINNER FRIENDLY)

Use these steps EVERY TIME you complete a new milestone or add new code.


STEP 0: GO TO PROJECT FOLDER
----------------------------
cd Desktop/learn_git

Why:
Git commands work only inside the project folder.


STEP 1: CHECK STATUS
--------------------
git status

Why:
Shows new files and modified files.
Helps you confirm what will be committed.


STEP 2: ADD FILES (STAGING)
---------------------------
Add all files:
git add .

Add a specific file:
git add milestone2.py

Why:
Selects which files should be included in the commit.


STEP 3: COMMIT WITH MESSAGE
---------------------------
git commit -m "Milestone 2: added new feature"

Why:
Saves a snapshot of your work.
Commit message explains WHAT you did.


GOOD COMMIT MESSAGE EXAMPLES
----------------------------
Milestone 1: initial project setup
Milestone 2: implemented login logic
Bug fix: corrected input validation
UI update: improved dashboard layout


STEP 4: PUSH TO GITHUB
----------------------
git push

Why:
Uploads your committed changes to GitHub.


ONE-LINE DAILY FLOW
-------------------
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Milestone X: short description"
git push


IMPORTANT RULES
---------------
1. Commit after every milestone
2. Push regularly (don’t wait for many days)
3. Always write meaningful commit messages
4. Never push without committing


INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (SIMPLE)
------------------------------
For every milestone, I check the status, stage the required files,
commit them with a meaningful message, and push the changes to GitHub
to maintain proper version history.
