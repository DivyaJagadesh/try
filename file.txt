FILE HANDLING (TXT, CSV, JSON) – CHEAT SHEET (PYTHON)

=====================================================

1️⃣ TXT FILE – READ, PROCESS, WRITE
📌 READ TXT FILE
# Read entire file
with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()

print(data)

# Read line by line
with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())

📌 PROCESS TXT DATA (Example)

Count number of words:

with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

words = text.split()
word_count = len(words)

📌 WRITE OUTPUT TO TXT
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Word Count: " + str(word_count))


Append mode:

with open("output.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nProcessed successfully")

2️⃣ CSV FILE – READ, PROCESS, WRITE
📌 READ CSV FILE
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)


Read with header:

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row["name"], row["marks"])

📌 PROCESS CSV DATA (Example)

Find average marks:

import csv

total = 0
count = 0

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        total += int(row["marks"])
        count += 1

average = total / count

📌 WRITE CSV OUTPUT
import csv

with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Average Marks"])
    writer.writerow([average])


Write multiple rows:

with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Marks"])
    writer.writerows([
        ["Divya", 85],
        ["Karthic", 90]
    ])

3️⃣ JSON FILE – READ, PROCESS, WRITE
📌 READ JSON FILE
import json

with open("data.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(data)


Access values:

print(data["name"])
print(data["marks"])

📌 PROCESS JSON DATA (Example)

Filter students with marks > 80:

result = []

for student in data["students"]:
    if student["marks"] > 80:
        result.append(student)

📌 WRITE JSON OUTPUT
import json

with open("output.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(result, f, indent=4)

4️⃣ COMBINED EXAMPLE (CSV → JSON)
import csv
import json

students = []

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        students.append(row)

with open("students.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(students, f, indent=4)
